# Voice-to-Text System

## Overview
This project implements a robust voice-to-text (speech recognition) system capable of processing audio input in real-time and converting it into text. It employs pre-trained models and advanced audio processing techniques to achieve high accuracy and performance across various accents and speaking styles.

## Features
- Real-time audio transcription
- Noise reduction and audio normalization
- Support for multiple accents and speaking styles
- Voice activity detection for efficient processing
- Easy-to-use interface for live audio input

-> Example Usage
Here’s an example scenario for testing:

Audio Pre-processing:

Prepare a noisy audio file (sample.wav) in your project directory.
Run python audio_processing.py sample.wav.
Check the generated chunk0.wav, chunk1.wav, etc., files for processed audio chunks.
Real-Time Transcription:

Ensure your microphone is connected and working.
Run python real_time_transcription.py.
Speak into the microphone and observe the transcriptions printed to the console.
Notes
Microphone Access: Ensure your system allows access to the microphone for real-time transcription.
Testing Environment: Use different audio samples and speaking styles to evaluate the system's performance.
Output: Monitor the console for any errors or issues during execution.
By following these steps, you can effectively test your voice-to-text system project and ensure it performs as expected before presenting it for evaluation or deployment.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd voice_to_text_system
   

2. Install the required packages:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

### Audio Pre-processing
To preprocess an audio file (e.g., `sample.wav`):

python audio_processing.py sample.wav

This will normalize the audio, reduce noise, and split it into chunks if necessary.

### Real-Time Transcription
To start the real-time transcription:

python real_time_transcription.py

The system will listen to live audio input and print the transcriptions to the console.

## Evaluation
The system has been evaluated for:
- Accuracy: High transcription accuracy across different accents and speaking styles.
- Performance: Efficient real-time processing with minimal latency.
- Robustness: Effective noise reduction and voice activity detection for clear audio input.

## Example Results
Here are some example transcriptions from different test scenarios:
- Accent 1: "Transcribed text for accent 1"
- Accent 2: "Transcribed text for accent 2"
- Noisy Environment: "Transcribed text in noisy conditions"

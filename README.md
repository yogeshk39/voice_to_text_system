# Voice-to-Text System

## Overview
This project implements a voice-to-text (speech recognition) system in Python using the `speech_recognition` library. The system captures audio input from a microphone, processes it to recognize speech, and outputs the transcribed text.

### Features
- Real-time speech recognition from microphone input.
- Support for multiple languages and accents.
- Error handling for varying audio qualities and network issues.
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voice-to-text-system
   

2. Install dependencies using `pip`:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   - Make sure Python and pip are installed on your system.

3. Set up `pyaudio` (dependency for microphone access):
   - For Windows:
     
     pip install pipwin
     pipwin install pyaudio
     
   - For macOS:
     
     brew install portaudio
     pip install pyaudio
     

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   
   python voice_to_text.py
   

2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - Speak into the microphone when prompted.
   - The system will attempt to transcribe your speech into text.
   - Transcribed text will be displayed on the console.
